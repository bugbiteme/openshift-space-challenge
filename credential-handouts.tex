  \noindent
The gentle hum of machinery is the first thing you notice as you
regain consciousness. You find yourself in the control room of a large
space station, floating in the vastness of space. The last thing you
remember is being aboard the starship Odyssey, but now, everything is
a blur. The space station seems eerily quiet, and you have no
recollection of what led you here.

  \vspace{1cm}

  \noindent
As you explore your surroundings, you discover that the space
station's systems are in disarray. The HAL 8000 AI system that
controls the station is offline, critical systems are malfunctioning,
and the communication array is damaged. At least the station's
OpenShift cluster appears to be functioning, providing you with a
glimmer of hope. Using the cluster, you can manage applications,
deploy solutions, and potentially restore the station's operations.

  \vspace{1cm}

  \noindent
Your mission is urgent and clear: you must restore the station's
functionality and find a way to communicate with the Interstellar
Federation. Time is running out, and your survival depends on your
ability to solve the challenges ahead.
