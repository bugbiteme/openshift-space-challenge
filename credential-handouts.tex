    \noindent
    The sun was merciless, burning overhead, as you awoke on the sandy
    shore of a seemingly deserted island. Scanning the horizon, the
    vastness of the ocean met your gaze in every direction,
    interrupted only by a distant, enigmatic monolith that stood alone
    on a rocky hill. Your memories of the events leading to this
    moment were blurry, but your trusty laptop, astonishingly, had
    survived the ordeal with you.

    \noindent
    Next to your laptop, buried partially in the sand, you found an
    unusual USB stick labeled "OpenShift Cluster." With nothing to
    lose, you plugged it in, and to your amazement, it powered up an
    entire cloud infrastructure right on your laptop. An idea began to
    form. If you could harness this cluster's power, perhaps you could
    find a way to communicate off the island using APIs and coded
    messages. But time is of the essence, and the challenges ahead are
    numerous.
