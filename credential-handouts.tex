  The sun was merciless, burning overhead, as you awoke on the sandy
  shore of a seemingly deserted island. Scanning the horizon, the
  vastness of the ocean met your gaze in every direction,
  interrupted only by a distant, enigmatic monolith that stood alone
  on a rocky hill. Your memories of the events leading to this
  moment were blurry, but your trusty laptop, astonishingly, had
  survived the ordeal with you.

  Next to your laptop, buried partially in the sand, you found an
  unusual USB stick labeled "OpenShift Cluster." With nothing to
  lose, you plugged it in, and to your amazement, it powered up an
  entire cloud infrastructure right on your laptop. An idea began to
  form. If you could harness this cluster's power, perhaps you could
  find a way to communicate off the island using APIs and coded
  messages. But time is of the essence, and the challenges ahead are
  numerous.
