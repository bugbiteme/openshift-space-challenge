Make sure to have the ``oc`` command-line tool installed.

Create a python environment and install all python modules dependancies.
``pip install -r requirements.txt``

Log on your OpenShift cluster using the ``oc login`` as admin.

Run ``ansible-playbook deploy.yaml``.

In addition to deploying CTFd, and gitea, the playbook creates player
accounts on OCP, ctfd and gitea.  Gitea credentials are
playerX/openshift.  Credentials for CTFd and OCP are found in
``credentials.txt``.  PDF handouts are ``credential-handouts.pdf``.

Log into ctfd, navigate to the backup config tab, and upload
`ctfg-upload-me.zip`.  This file was generated by the `deploy.yaml`
playbook run.

Run ``make-user-creds.sh`` if you ever wish to generate a new batch
credentials.
